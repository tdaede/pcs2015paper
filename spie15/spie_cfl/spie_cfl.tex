\begin{abstract}
This paper describes a technique for performing intra prediction of the chroma
 planes based on the reconstructed luma plane in the frequency domain.
This prediction exploits the fact that while RGB to YUV color conversion has
 the property that it decorrelates the color planes globally across an image,
 there is still some correllation locally at the block level\cite{LeeCho09}.
Previous proposals compute a linear model of the spatial relationship between
 the luma plane (Y) and the two chroma planes (U and V)\cite{JCTVCB021}.
In codecs that use lapped transforms this is not possible since transform
 support extends across the block boundaries\cite{Tran2003}.
We design a frequency domain intra predictor for chroma that exploits the same
 local correlation with lower complexity than the spatial predictor and which
 works with lapped transforms.


%(need to talk about improvements over other forms of intra prediction)
%(what about complexity, fewer multiplies when predicting the model)

\section{INTRODUCTION}
\label{sec:intro}  % \label{} allows reference to this section

Still image and video codecs typically consider the problem of intra-prediction
 in the spatial domain.
A predicted image is generated on a block-by-block basis using the previously
 reconstructed neighboring blocks for reference, and the residual is encoded
 using standard entropy coding techniques.
Modern codecs use the boundary pixels of the neighboring blocks along with a
 directional mode to predict the pixel values across the current block (e.g.,
 AVC, HEVC, VP8, WebP, etc.).
These directional predictors are cheap to compute (often directly copying pixel
 values or applying a simple linear kernel), exploit local coherency (with low
 error near the neighbors) and predict hard to code features (extending sharp
 directional edges across the block).

%In the Daala video codec, we use a reversible lapped transform to 
In codecs that use lapped transforms these techniques are not applicable (e.g.,
 VC-1, JPEG-XR, Daala, etc.).
The challenge here is that the neighboring spatial image data is not available
 until {\em after} the current block has been decoded and the appropriate
 unlapping filter has been applied across the block boundaries.
Figure \ref{fig:decode} shows the decode pipeline of a codec using lapped
 transforms with a single block size.
The support used in spatial intra prediction is exactly the region that has not
 had the unlapping post-filter applied.
Note that the pre-filter has the effect of decorrelating the image along block
 boundaries so that the neighboring pixel values before unlapping are
 particularly unsuitable for use in prediction.
