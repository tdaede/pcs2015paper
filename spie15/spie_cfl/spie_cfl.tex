\begin{abstract}
This paper describes a technique for performing intra prediction of the chroma
 planes based on the reconstructed luma plane in the frequency domain.
This prediction exploits the fact that while RGB to YUV color conversion has
 the property that it decorrelates the color planes globally across an image,
 there is still some correllation locally at the block level\cite{LeeCho09}.
Previous proposals compute a linear model of the spatial relationship between
 the luma plane (Y) and the two chroma planes (U and V)\cite{JCTVCB021}.
In Daala this is not possible due to the use of lapped transforms which overlap
 block boundaries\cite{Tran2003}.
We design a frequency domain intra predictor for chroma that exploits the same
 local correlation with lower complexity than the spatial predictor and which
 works with lapped transforms.


%(need to talk about improvements over other forms of intra prediction)
%(what about complexity, fewer multiplies when predicting the model)

Still image and Video codecs typically consider the problem of intra-prediction
 in the spatial domain.
A predicted image is generated on a block-by-block basis using the previously
 reconstructed neighboring blocks for reference, and the residual is encoded
 using standard entropy coding techniques.
Modern codecs use the boundary pixels of the neighboring blocks along with a
 directional mode to predict the pixel values across the current block.
